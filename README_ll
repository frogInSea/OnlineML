Implementation of Instances and relevant classes used in the following learning procedure

Mainly difference is that this version of instances removes the FastVector class, resulting in a much simplified dataset representation.

however, this class is just an initial one, and have been tested on 
	1. loading data containing real, numerical, nominal attributes 
	2. loading full and sparse data
	3. transmition from a client to a server
so, so far the following works have to been done next
	1. the functions needed in the learning procedure are not implemented
	2. date, string attributes are not tested
